## Installation

In order to use the Note Taker, it is necessary to have a code editor, such as Visual Studio Code (VSCode), and Node.js installed on your system.

1. Begin by installing Node.js on your computer's terminal/command-line. For detailed installation instructions, vist Node.js.org.

2. Initiate the cloning process from the GitHub repository by selecting "Code." Copy the SSH link then execute the `git clone <paste SSH link>` command in your terminal/command-line. Next, open the cloned project in your preferred code editor.

3. Verify the installation of npm, which usually comes bundled with Node.js. Execute the command `npm -v` in the intergrated terminal to confirm that you have the latest version downloaded. If npm is not installed, run the command `npm i` before continuing.
